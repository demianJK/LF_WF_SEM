# LF_WF_SEM
R code and data for simulation study, tables and figures.

If you want to run the simulation, check out run.R and summarize.R
If you want to see the aggregated results on all 240 simulation conditions check out objects/Tablestats.xlsx.
If you want to create figures and tables, check out scripts/figures.R and simRegression.R. The required data frame is in objects/dat.R.
If you want to use our function to specifiy and fit an intercept-only model in LF or WF see scripts/functions/analyzeData.R.

Have fun!
